# Social Mapping App (Frontend + Local Dev Server)

This folder contains the Next.js application used for both production deployment (via Vercel) and local development. It includes:

- The frontend app (React + Next.js)
- The embedded local WebSocket server (for development only)
- MongoDB dev environment connection

## Local Development

Start MongoDB (or ensure access to Cluster0 on Atlas), then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
